 # How to behave?
I try to adopt a very simple approach, based on the reality of everyday life for many parents. 
The first story interprets the behaviour to be applied in different situations and places and the purpose of having a connected watch is to familiarise the child with certain situations, whether good or dubious, and above all to avoid a possible kidnapping or assault
The purpose of using the connected watch is to put it in park mode, for example, so that it can be used for leisure activities and also to activate geolocation to find friends scattered around the park.
