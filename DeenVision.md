## Techniques
  Once I decided on a topic, I defined the characters. Jake is a simple American man, while Amelie is a simple French woman. It was important that they don't speak each others languages so they could focus on connecting only because of the food, and because of the format. We are presenting this with AI generated images and small descriptions of the scenes, dialogue would only get in the programmers way. 

  Following the character descriptions I found foods I wanted to work with, beouf bourgenon, classic american burger, and story boarded a simple scene where one of them sits down, offers food to the other, they eat it, and then express connection. This was simple, and worked, but didn't show off the AI program as well as I thought it could. To expand on the story I set up a looping system where the two sample each others meals until one of them feels a strong emotion. 

  The loop looks like this: Someone sits down, they order, and the computer picks one of the two characters to begin the interaction. Then a random number will choose between offering food to the other, eating food, or just looking at the other person. The other person will then make the same choice. If someone eats, another random number will decide if the character offers food back, or feels a strong emotion towards the food and ends the story.
