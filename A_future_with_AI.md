My goal was to create a generative story that allows a user to see the effects of AI on the world after legislation regarding its use is passed.
We start at the UN (In this world the UN is the governing body for all decisions regarding AI). In out world, we start at state 0 which is the neutral state where the effects of AI on civilization are not too great. There are 11 states, -5 to 5. Depending on our state, we are asked a question with degree +/- 1 of the current state. The flow of the story is picture of policy maker in the UN => Pass/Veto legislation => see impact via generated picture of new society => repeat. For each decision, we associate a probability of it actually being a good decision. This is meant to reflect that sometimes seemingly excellent legislation can result in adverse consequences. For each equation we have a probability p. If we select pass, then the state increases +1 with probability p. If we select veto, then the state will decrease with probability 1-p. Eventually we would add more questions and allow for a voting system which takes into consideration how many times someones passes a vote and the total number of times it has been voted on and use this communal grading to determine the degree number than having it hard coded.
