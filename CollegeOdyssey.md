# Project Title : Dawn of the Wasteland: A College Odyssey

I have always been a fan of The Walking Dead series which has grown into a love for the franchise and other similar apocalyptic themed works. So, it was only natural that I used that interest to inspire my story for this project. Titled "Dawn of the Wasteland: A College Odyssey", this generative narrative follows the story of a character in college navigating the beginning of a post-apocalyptic world and their journey to find their family. The main question is can the user select the best choices to keep the character alive? My inspiration for this story derives from other sources as well - for one, an apocalyptic journey shown from the perspective of a college student stems from my curiosity as a college student myself and a horror fan who has yet to see a fictional experience of a college-aged student navigate worlds such as the ones I've seen. Other inspirations are The Walking Dead mobile game and a similar series, The Last of Us, which I used to create the various potential storylines of the character. The knowledge from the media I've watched helped me better construct the environment and the rapid transition of a world from normal to disastrous by adapting the structure of apocalyptic storytelling and character development.

The main basis of an authentic apocalyptic story is how realistic it is and an important part of that is unpredictablity. The Walking Dead gained such acclaim and popularity not only for it's excellent and complex story with distinguished characters, but because the audience could not predict what would happen. Favorite characters could be killed off at any moment and oftentimes without forewarning which is realistic because anyone would be vulnerable in the real world and no one can predict the future. I aimed to incorporate this in my story. I wanted to create many different paths the main character could take and using a generative AI helps accomplish this because one decision can split off into several potential decisions and this network of possibilities enables the user to generate a unique story every time. In real life, no one knows which decision will ultimately be the right one, in fictional apocalyptic stories, decisonmaking is key to survival yet the characters are never sure that the decisions they'll make could end up fatal. In my story, any series of decisions dictates the character's fate: the character's survival or untimely death. Behind the scenes, I created several events in the Omeka database that represent the potential actions and decisions of the character. I established three initial conditions (to limit complexity) that starts the character's journey then the story could branch off into several different directions based off if an event is validated or failed. Ultimately, the story is an assortment of randomly selected events, although I skewed the likelihood of some events based off how likely they occurred in series I've watched plus how likely they were to occur in the real world.

To generate the images for each scene in the story, I utilized ComfyUI and PromptHero. Initially, I inputted a prompt that expresses the scene in the story I want to capture. ComfyUI uses its default parameters to generate the image. Although it generated what I asked for, the style was not what I wanted. So, I referred to PromptHero for examples of AI generated images with styles I liked, copied the prompts of those images (or dragged the image into ComfyUI to import the specific parameters), then tailored the prompts to my specific request. Once I inputted the updated prompt, the new image better fit what I was looking for as shown below:

I also used another source, an AI Comic Strip Maker called LlamaGen.Ai. Inspired by The Walking Dead comics, I wanted to include comic style images in my story then compile the panels at the end to form a comic strip. In LlamaGen.Ai, the user inputs a prompt and selects the settings of the comic strip including font, number of panels, etc. then once it is submitted, the tool uses the inputted prompt to create more detailed prompts for each panel and generates images of the full strip. For example, I put in "Young black female college student with curly hair wakes up late for class" then for 4 panels the AI generated 4 prompts: 

Panel 1
((masterpiece,best quality))grayscale,detailed drawing,japanese manga,,one female, Black, black natural curls hair, 20 years old, ((dressed in comfortable pajamas)), Peaceful, Asleep on a bed, partially covered by a blanket, with one hand resting on an open textbook, College dorm room, Early morning, Soft morning sunlight streaming through the window

Panel 2
((masterpiece,best quality))grayscale,detailed drawing,japanese manga,,one female, Black, black natural curls hair, 20 years old, ((dressed in comfortable pajamas)), Startled, Sitting up abruptly in bed with wide eyes, reaching towards an alarm clock on the bedside table, College dorm room, Early morning, Soft morning sunlight with a bit more light than the previous panel

Panel 3
((masterpiece,best quality))grayscale,detailed drawing,japanese manga,,one female, Black, black natural curls hair, 20 years old, ((dressed in comfortable pajamas)), Determined, Standing beside the bed, hurriedly getting dressed, checking her reflection in a small mirror, College dorm room, Early morning, Sunlight growing warmer as morning advances

Panel 4
((masterpiece,best quality))grayscale,detailed drawing,japanese manga,,one female, Black, black natural curls hair, 20 years old, ((dressed in comfortable pajamas)), Focused, Walking briskly through the hallway with a backpack slung over one shoulder, glancing at her watch, College dorm hallway, Early morning, Bright light from windows along the hallway

The resulting panel:
